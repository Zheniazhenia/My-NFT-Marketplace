# My-NFT-Marketplace

I used:
Solidity andOpenZeppelin for smartcontracts
React.js, HTML, CSS for front-end
Node.js, ethers.js and Hardhat for back-end and local usage
Chai.js for tests
Infura IPFS for decentralized storage of nfts data
etc

It's my first big project at web3 development. 
I learned a lot of things making this project and get some experience and understanding of a couple of processes.
I was not bother a lot about UI and concentrate on a code part, because I'm still not close familiar with React, so I left it for a future tries.

On a platform of Marketplace you can:
- Create your own NFT, put it on sale 
- Purchase somebody's NFT which you can find on marketplace. 
- Track all your listed NFTs and all your purchases in a history. 


To run it on your PC you need to input your personal API keys from Infura IPFS Service.
In terminal run: npx run hardhat
To generate keys and contract in another terminal windiw: npx hardhat run src/backend/scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
To see platform use localhost:3000/ 


I used a open-source youtube videoguide made by DappUniversity.
